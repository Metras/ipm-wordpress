= Introduction =

The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate how to create and manage photos and slideshows using WordPress and the slideshow plugin.

It is recommended that you use Mozilla Firefox to upload photos using WPSS; Safari and Internet Explorer should work as well, but they have not been completely tested.

==Uploading and labeling photos==

Once you have opened Firefox, log into the Wordpress wp-admin area and enter your username and password.  When you view a list of posts from wp-admin, you will be able to see whether a post already has a photo associated by observing the far-right column. If there is already a title in bold, this post already has a photo associated.

To upload a photo, click on the post title to edit, and then scroll down until you see a box called Slideshow.  Most articles will only need a single photo, so click on the Single Photo button, then the Add photo button.

This will bring up the WPSS photo selection screen.  Usually, you will want to upload a new photo for an article.  If you want to choose a photo that's already in the photo library, however, you may click on the See all button, or use the search field if you know the name of the image.
